README for fixed client for traffic
-----------------------------------

This client uses the payload and protocols passed to it to create a fixed
number of connections and send a steady stream of payloads down it. It will
read the reply and discard it.

Clients take minimum, maximum, increment and time parameters.

The fixed client ignores all the parameters except the maximum parameter.
This is the number of instances it will create to send data to the server.
