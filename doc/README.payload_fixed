README for fixed payload for traffic
------------------------------------

This payload will return a fixed size packet to be sent to the server.

Payloads normally accept minimum, maximum, increment and time as parameters.

The fixed payload ignores all of these parameters except maximum to
determine the size of the payload the send. This maximum should be at least
8.
