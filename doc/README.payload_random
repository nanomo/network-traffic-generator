README for random payload for traffic
------------------------------------

This payload will return a random size packet to be sent to the server.

Payloads normally accept minimum, maximum, increment and time as parameters.

The random payload will select a random size between the minimum and maximum
specified and will return this sized payload [time] times. The increment
parameter is ignored.
