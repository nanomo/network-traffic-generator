README for interfaces to traffic
--------------------------------

Currently there is only one interface to traffic and that is the command
line version. Documentation on how to use that can be found in
cmdline/README.

Each of the interfaces uses the plug-ins. The following plug-ins exist and
documentation for them can be found under:

README.server
README.client
README.protocols
README.reply
README.payload
